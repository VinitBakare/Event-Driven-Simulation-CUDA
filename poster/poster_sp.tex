%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\textbf{More than half} of the effort in the design phase goes for verification and validation of the design! \\ 
Performance for gate level netlist simulation is extremely low; typically it takes \textbf{days} to validate a particular design. But netlist simulation performance is quite significant since short times-to-market limit the coverage that can be achieved in verification. Thus, faster verification methods are needed to improve coverage.

\begin{enumerate}
\item get the inputs
\item process the inputs
\item get the outputs

\subsection*{Simulation Types}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Straightforward :} Simulate all sequentially!
\item \textbf{Parallel :} Simulate parallel if you can!
\item \textbf{Event-Driven : } Simulate parts if needed!

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\emph{CUDA[1] stands for \emph{Compute Unified Device Architecture}. It is a parallel programming platform and a programming model created by NVIDIA. It enables programmers to develop programs using massively parallel architecture of GPUs.}
\begin{itemize}
\item[+] Easy to learn
\item[+] C + some gpu related calls
\item[+] Easily wrappable for C++
\item[-] Architecture dependent
\item[-] NVDIA only
\item[-] Host-Device distance
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{itemize}
\item CUDA version 5.0 , currently being developed for full C++ support
\item Have helper libraries like Thrust[2], CUBLAS[3]
\item Atomic operations for integer and float
\item Multiple GPU support
\item Same naming : cudaMalloc(), cudaMemcpy() 
\item OpenGL integration
\item Several Built-in Memory types: Global, shared, texture
\item function$<<<blocks,threads>>>$(args...)
